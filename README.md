# Machine Learning Trading Alogrithm

This notebook is built to practice and fine tune machine learning alogrithms to build a trading bot that will accurately predict returns. After establishing a baseline algorithm, the user can import and implement different classifiers to see which most accurately predict returns when backtested.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - Data analysis and manipulation tool

* [Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - Offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) - Fundamental package for scientific computing in Python

* [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - A familiar and high-level API for data exploration and visualization

* [ScikitLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) - Open source data analysis library for Machine Learning (ML) in the Python ecosystem
